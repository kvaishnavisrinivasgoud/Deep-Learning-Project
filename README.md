# Deep-Learning-Project

Install Required Libraries:

-Make sure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using pip:

              pip install tensorflow matplotlib


Output:

1.The model will train for 10 epochs and display the training/validation accuracy and loss curves.

2.A confusion matrix will show how well the model performs for each class.

3.The model will be saved as cifar10_cnn_model.h5.

Example Results:

-Test Accuracy: ~70-75% (can be improved with more epochs, data augmentation, or a deeper model).

-Visualizations: Graphs for accuracy/loss and a confusion matrix.

This is a basic implementation. You can improve the model by:

  1.Adding data augmentation.

  2.Using a deeper architecture (e.g., ResNet, VGG).

  3.Training for more epochs.

  4.Using transfer learning with a pre-trained model
